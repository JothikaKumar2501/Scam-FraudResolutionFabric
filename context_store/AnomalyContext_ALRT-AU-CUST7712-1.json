The sequence of events (password update at 09:12 followed by large transfer at 09:38) indicates potential account takeover. While the customer has high digital literacy and a low risk profile, the behavior pattern deviates significantly from normal activity patterns, especially considering the transaction occurred to an unknown recipient immediately after credential changes.\"}"
