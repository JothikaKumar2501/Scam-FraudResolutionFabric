This pattern strongly indicates an unauthorized party gained access to the account, changed credentials to lock out the legitimate owner, then quickly executed a large transfer to extract funds. The short timeframe between password change and transfer suggests urgency to complete the fraud before detection. The customer's casual inquiry about 'what's the issue' could indicate they are unaware of these transactions, further supporting the likelihood of account compromise.\"\n}\n```"
