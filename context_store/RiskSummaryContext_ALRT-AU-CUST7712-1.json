The pattern of password change followed by immediate large transfer ($15,000) to an unknown PayID recipient within 26 minutes is a classic indicator of unauthorized account access. Despite the customer having high digital literacy and low risk profile, this sequence strongly suggests criminal activity.\",\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Multiple red flags indicate a scam in progress: 1) Password update at 09:12 immediately followed by large transfer at 09:38 (only 26 minutes gap), 2) Substantial amount ($15,000), 3) Transfer to unknown PayID recipient, 4) Transaction triggered high-priority alert in risk queue. The timing and sequence of events match typical account takeover patterns where credentials are changed before quickly moving funds out to untraceable destinations. The customer's normally low risk profile makes this behavior even more anomalous.\"\n}"
