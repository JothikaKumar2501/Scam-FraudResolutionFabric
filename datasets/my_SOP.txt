## 🛡️ STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

**Title**: FTP Alert Handling & Agentic Triage Protocol
**Department**: Fraud Risk & Intelligence
**Issued By**: Head of Financial Crime Compliance
**Effective Date**: 08 July 2025 | **Version**: 3.1
**Applies To**: Fraud Analysts, Agentic Triage, Digital Operations, Contact Centre, Case Management Teams

---

### 1. PURPOSE

Define a **compliant**, **risk‑driven**, and **data‑grounded** framework to triage, validate, and resolve fraud alerts automatically with GenAI agents—protecting customers & meeting APRA, ASIC, AUSTRAC, and Scamwatch requirements.

---

### 2. SCOPE

* Covers all FTP‑generated alerts across Online, Mobile, SWIFT, PayID, BPAY, etc.
* Enemy vectors include credential compromise, account takeover, BEC, crypto/investment scams, device/IP anomalies.

---

### 3. CONTEXT & INPUTS

All alerts pass through an **MCP Orchestrator**, which creates structured, schema‑driven contexts:

* **TransactionContext**
* **UserContext**
* **MerchantContext**
* **DeviceContext**
* **SOPContext** (bank’s policies & exception logic)
* **AlertContext** (FTP metadata)

Agents communicate via MCP, ensuring full traceability and auditable logs of the exact data considered.

---

### 4. TRIAGE DECISION RULES

The **Triage Agent** applies SOP‑driven logic, enriched with real‑time GenAI reasoning:

| Strategy                         | Rule ID     | Call Required IF…                                                     | Skip IF…                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Password Change + Large Transfer | RUL‑TX901   | Transfer >5k in 60 min after password change AND unknown payee        | Payee trusted >3 mths, matches usual patterns   |
| New Device + Large Transfer      | RUL‑TX817   | New device → transfer >10k → destination = investment/crypto platform | Biometrics verified; previously approved device |
| Investment‑Scam                  | RUL‑TX488   | First‑time >5k to unlicensed/unverified entity OR on blacklist        | *Never skip*                                    |
| Full Balance Outflow             | RUL‑TX778   | 80%+ balance moved to unknown/crypto or multiple rapid transfers      | *Never skip*                                    |
| Offshore Transfer                | RUL‑TX234   | New offshore >10k to high‑risk jurisdiction                           | If licensed entity AND typical pattern          |
| Drip Transfer Anomaly            | RUL‑TX155   | Daily small transfers >3 days totaling >2k, round amounts             | Matches existing pattern                        |
| Invoice Redirection              | RUL‑TX230   | Vendor bank details changed & payment >10% deviation from norm        | Securely verified change                        |
| New Device + Account Cleanout    | RUL‑TX817v2 | Unverified device + >50% balance → crypto transfers out-of-hours      | *Never skip*                                    |

This agent uses **MCP to fetch SOPContext** and retrieve real-time customer/device history before applying thresholds.

### 5. AGENTIC MODULES & CONNECTORS

* **Context Store**: All agents share and update contexts via MCP, including **RiskSummaryContext**, **DecisionContext**, and **DialogueContext**.
* **Decision Agent**: Leverages GenAI (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) for logical reasoning and explanations, fused with numeric rule checks.
* **Dialogue Agent**: Uses **LangGraph** to generate adaptive question flows (identity, transaction background, investment details), storing results in **DialogueContext**.
* **Risk Assessor**: Reviews conversation context; detects scam indicators and either finalizes or triggers further questioning loop.
* **SOP Agent**: Manning the SOPContext—providing SOP rules, escalation criteria, contact templates on demand.

---

### 6. CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT

**Caller**: “Hi \[Name], it’s \[Agent] from \[Bank]. We noticed a \[high‑value crypto/investment] transaction of $\[X]. Did you authorize this and are you certain the recipient is ASIC‑licensed?”

Prompts follow a logical progression from identity validation to deeper probing into scam indicators.

---

### 7. ESCALATION & HANDOVERS

* **Tier 1 (Agentic)**: Auto-resolution if calls not required.
* **Tier 2 (Human Analyst)**: If flagged high-risk, Geo-jurisdictional complexity, device anomalies, or >\$20k.
* **Tier 3 (Legal/Compliance)**: Requires police/reporting/AUSTRAC.

---

### 8. SLA & MONITORING

| Priority | Agent Call SLA | Resolution SLA | Monitoring Cycle |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| High     | 30 mins        | 2 hours        | Daily            |
| Medium   | 2 hours        | 6 hours        | Bi‑weekly        |
| Low      | Same day       | 24 hours       | Monthly QA       |

Performance metrics feed into the **FeedbackContext** to optimize agent chains.

---

### 9. AUDIT, SECURITY & GOVERNANCE

* Full **MCP logs**: context reads/writes, tool calls, decisions, timestamps.
* **Guardrails & ACLs** implemented per-context and agent-role to prevent unauthorized data flow — aligning with enterprise-grade risk mitigations ([k2view.com][1], [swimlane.com][2], [digitalocean.com][3], [en.wikipedia.org][4], [anthropic.com][5]).
* MCP servers take responsibility for schema validation and security controls.

---

### 10. COMPLIANCE & REFERENCES

* Grounded in **APRA CPG 234**, **ASIC**, **AUSTRAC**, **Scamwatch**.
* Leverages **MCP standard** for secure, auditable data access ([k2view.com][1]).
* Uses context-driven SOP enforcement consistent with best practices in rapid fraud triage .
