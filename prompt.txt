We have to use gen ai to automate fraud scam alerts. So I will have a Json file with the customers supicious transaction
details and I have the details of the customer( his transaction history, demmographics) and the SOPs of the bank. 
First the json file is passed to an agent called triage agent. By analyzing the customer details, SOPs and the sucpicious 
transaction it will make a decision whether to call the customer or not. If no it will provide a proper end analysis. 
if yes the taks is transfered to another agent called- Dialogue agent so this dialogue agent is a chat bot it will ask 
the questions to customer based on the answers it hads to decide whether its a scam or not. the questions 
include: introductory questions based on transaction transaction type and also the basic questions ( like his name and all) 
ask follow up questions baseed on conversation.  these conversations are passed to Risk  Assessor agent . 
this agent reviews the conversation for scam and fraud indicators. it has to do the following tasks: risk score for 
conversation, suggest follow up questions, check for scam indicators. if it doesn't have enough information it 
goes back to the dialogue agent and now the dialogues agent has to come up with its own questions and agin the 
conversations are passed to risk assesor agent. so this can be some 3/4 loops. if it has enough informsation it 
will give an end analysis with reasoning and scam alert. so I want you to help me build the multi agentic system.
