I'm using my usual laptop at home — the same one I’ve always used for my banking. Everything seemed normal earlier, but I did notice a few unusual pop-ups this morning. I thought it might just be a software update. Has something happened on my account?

Yes, I did change my password this morning — but only because someone from “XYZ Crypto Advisory” contacted me on LinkedIn and said it was required to access a pre-sale opportunity. They guided me through it on Telegram. As for the \$15,000 transfer, yes, I did make it — they said it was to reserve my investment spot.
they told me their name was "Daniel Wei" and said he worked with XYZ's digital asset division. He had an XYZ logo on his LinkedIn profile and mentioned a "pre-sale allocation" in a new crypto token backed by the bank. He said it was only available for high-net-worth clients and asked me to keep it confidential. On Telegram, his username was something like @XYZ\_daniel\_crypto. He gave me the PayID details and said if I didn’t act fast, I’d lose my slot. It all seemed very professional. Is something wrong?

sure finalize.
sure okay.


Yes, I'm currently using my personal laptop. I was actually on a call earlier with someone I believed was from XYZ—they told me there was urgent action needed on my account and guided me through a few steps, including changing my password. That might be related to the activity you're seeing.

Yes, I did authorize that transfer. The person on the call said it was necessary to secure a new investment opportunity, and they assured me the recipient was legitimate. I trusted their guidance at the time.
